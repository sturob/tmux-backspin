# tmux-history

A back button and a bit of tmux infrastructure to support it. Works across sessions.

## Why is this necessary?

If you rarely navigate between sessions in tmux then it's not. If you do, however, you might not be satified with having to consciously work out if you want to go to back to the previous window in this session, or need to go back to the previous session. They are separate commands. With this you just go back to the last window you were looking at, regardless of where it is.

## Default bindings

- alt-b = back
or
- prefix-backspace = back

## Not yet supported

- separate clients

- linked windows
